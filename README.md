# JavaScript Quiz

## Description
In order to test myself and peers on the fundamentals of JavaScript, I have created a user-friendly quiz using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. There are five questions total, and a timer counts down from 75 when the user clicks the "Start" button. It's simple to see the answers as you navigate through each question, with text that appears to show you whether the selection you made was Correct or Wrong. 

Users can see their final score on the results page, and enter their initials to save their scores. If you wish to take the quiz again, you can click the "Go back" button. 

I learned about using functions to display or hide elements, and making functions that control other functions (such as starting and stopping the timer).

## Usage

Users that take this quiz are timed and able to see their highscores, test their knowledge and see when they choose incorrect or correct answers, start the quiz over, or clear the scores saved. When the user selects a wrong answer, the timer decreases by 7 seconds. When the timer gets to 0, the quiz ends and the user is brought to the results screen.
